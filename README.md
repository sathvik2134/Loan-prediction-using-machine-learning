# Loan-prediction-using-machine-learning


This project predicts whether a loan will be approved based on applicant information using machine learning models including Logistic Regression and XGBoost.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is from Analytics Vidhya’s Loan Prediction challenge. It contains information such as:
- Applicant Income
- Coapplicant Income
- Loan Amount
- Credit History
- Gender, Marital Status, Education, etc.

Target variable: `Loan_Status` (Y = Approved, N = Not Approved)
